# HR Attrition Analysis
HR attrition analysis involves studying the rate at which employees leave an organization (turnover) and identifying the underlying causes to improve retention strategies. It typically uses data such as employee demographics (age, gender, education, department, job role), job-related factors (job involvement, work-life balance), and compensation details (monthly income, salary hikes, stock options). The process includes calculating the overall turnover rate and analyzing patterns across these variables using statistical tools and visualizations like bar charts, box plots, and KDE plots. Key insights often reveal that lower income, poor work-life balance, and low job involvement correlate with higher attrition, while higher earners and those with better benefits tend to stay. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations, such as adjusting salaries or enhancing job satisfaction, to reduce turnover and maintain a stable workforce.
